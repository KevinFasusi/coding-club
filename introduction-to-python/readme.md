This session will cover the basics of python, including syntax, using the 'print' command, using python as a calculator, assigning variables and python data types. This will be an interactive session and participants will be given simple code based exercises to complete during the session. 

# coding-club-IntroPython-2
This session will cover the basics of python building off the topics which were covered in Session 1. Control flow and if-statements will be covered in session 2. This will be an interactive session and participants will be given simple code based exercises to complete during the session.

# coding-club-IntroPython-3
This session will cover the basics of python building off the topics which were covered in Session 2. Loops and lists will be covered in session 3. This will be an interactive session and participants will be given simple code based exercises to complete during the session.

# coding-club-IntroPython-4
This session will cover the basics of python building off the topics which were covered in Session 3. Loop and the python library NumPy will be covered in session 4. This will be an interactive session and participants will be given simple code based exercises to complete during the session.

# coding-club-IntroPython-5

This session focus on the basics of Pandas, a package similar to NumPy which contains tools and data structures for working with data. We will look at the key data structures that Pandas contains, how to create them, and how to extract basic information from them. 

# coding-club-IntroPython-6
This continues directly from session 5, and covers further functionality contained within Pandas.
